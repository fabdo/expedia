###Expedia - Hotels Deals###

A simple page that displays a list of hotel deals and enable you to filter the results according to certain criteria such as city name, travel dates and hotel rates.

###Language & Installation###

I used PHP to build this application, Instead of using open source framework; I built my own MVC structure. Easy to install and run, You only need to clone the repository on any environment/server that runs PHP (ex: Apache server), Then navigate to http://localhost/offers

###Why PHP###
PHP can be used on all major operating systems, including Linux, many Unix variants (including HP-UX, Solaris and OpenBSD), Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, RISC OS, and probably others. PHP also has support for most of the web servers today. This includes Apache, IIS, and many others. And this includes any web server that can utilize the FastCGI PHP binary, like lighttpd and nginx. PHP works as either a module, or as a CGI processor. 

###Experience in PHP###
I have a 7+ years of experience in PHP
